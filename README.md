# box-framework
Contains class names with styling(includes padding, margin).
In general a front end designer face problem while designing a website which contains many blocks with different paddings and margins for such site he/she has to style accordingly and for the next project he/she should style again, here with the box.css one can just link the file and use the class names. It helps to reduces the redundancy.

Examples:

PD10 - provides padding: 10px
MGT10 - provides margin-top: 10px
